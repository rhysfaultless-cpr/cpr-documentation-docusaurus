### Status panel

The status panel is a display of LED indicators located on the rear of the chassis which provide information about the current status of Husky.
The indicators are described in the table below.

|                      Icon                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :--------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img src="/img/robot_husky_3.png" width="50"/> | **Battery Status** The four LED segments provide an approximate indication of the relative lifetime remaining in the battery.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| <img src="/img/robot_husky_4.png" width="50"/> | **Communication Status** When green, Husky is receiving a stream of correctly-formatted motion commands, and is ready to drive. When yellow, Husky is receiving commands, but will not drive due to emergency stop or another error. When red, serial communications are currently timed-out. |
| <img src="/img/robot_husky_5.png" width="50"/> | **General Error Status** Illuminates red when Husky will not drive due to an error state. Such states include emergency stop, insufficient battery power, or an unspecified software error.                                                                                                   |
| <img src="/img/robot_husky_6.png" width="50"/> | **Emergency Stop Status** Illuminates red when Husky will not drive due to the emergency stop being activated, either onboard or wireless (if available).                                                                                                                                     |
| <img src="/img/robot_husky_7.png" width="50"/> | **Charge Indicator** Illuminates red when Husky user power is being supplied externally.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Orientation references

The reference frame used by all Clearpath Robotics ground vehicles is based on ISO 8855, and is shown in the figure below.
Husky's front is shown.
When commanded with a positive translational velocity (forward), wheels travel in the positive x-direction.
The direction of the axes differs from those used for roll, pitch, and yaw in aircraft, and care should be taken to ensure that data is interpreted correctly.

### Pinout

Husky provides a female DE-9 connector for communication with a host device.
The pinout of this connector is shown below.

The connectors used in the Husky's user bay  are Weidmüller's 6 Position Terminal Blocks, to connect your own bare wires, you may use Digi-key part number 281-1856-ND.

### Vehicle Equations

As a starting point, Clearpath Robotics recommends using the following relationship between wheel velocity and platform velocity:

$$
v=\cfrac{v_{r}+v_{l}}{2}
$$

$$
\omega=\cfrac{v_{r}-v_{l}}{w}
$$

$v$ represents the instantaneous translational speed of the platform and $\omega$ the instantaneous rotational speed. <br />
$v_{r}$ and $v_{l}$ are the right and left wheel velocities, respectively. <br />
$w$ is the effective track of the vehicle, 0.555 m.

## Safety

Clearpath Robotics is committed to high standards of safety. 
Husky contains several features to protect the safety of users and the integrity of the vehicle.

### General warnings

Husky is a rugged and high-performance vehicle. 
For the safety of yourself and others, always conduct initial experiments and software development with the vehicle raised off the ground.
Place a wooden crate, a set of sawhorses, a sturdy storage tub, or any other solid flat structure having a height greater than 150 mm under Husky to keep the wheels clear of the ground (“up on blocks”).

When starting out, favour slower wheel speeds. 
Husky's control loops can accurately maintain velocities as low as 0.1 m/s. 
Operating at such speeds will give you more time to react if things don't go quite as you expect.

When Husky is operating, keep clear of the wheels, paying particular attention to the pinch hazard which exists between each wheel and the end of the corresponding bumper bar.
