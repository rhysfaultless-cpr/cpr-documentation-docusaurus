### What's included

Contained in your Husky shipment are the following items:

- Clearpath Robotics Husky
- 24V Sealed Lead-Acid Battery Pack
- Battery Door Cover
- Battery Charger
- Lockout Keys (2X)
- Power Connectors (3X)

### What's required

To use Husky, you will require a PC capable of running Robot Operating System (ROS).
If a computer option was purchased from Clearpath Robotics with Husky, then the included laptop or minicomputer has
already been configured with Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS Noetic, plus appropriate ROS packages and other configuration for use with Husky.

### Expansions

To expand the capabilities of Husky, consider the following accessories offered by Clearpath Robotics:

- Spare Battery
- IMU
- LIDAR
- Network Camera
- GPS

Each sensor package ships from Clearpath Robotics with a custom mounting bracket and cabling for easy attachment to Husky's extruded aluminum payload mounting rail.

## The basics

This section provides an overview of the key specifications of the Husky platform.
The figure below gives a tour of key Husky components.

### Status panel

The status panel is a display of LED indicators located on the rear of the chassis which provide information about the current status of Husky.
The indicators are described in the table below.

|                      Icon                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| :--------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <img src="/img/robot_husky_3.png" width="50"/> | **Battery Status** The four LED segments provide an approximate indication of the relative lifetime remaining in the battery.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| <img src="/img/robot_husky_4.png" width="50"/> | **Communication Status** When green, Husky is receiving a stream of correctly-formatted motion commands, and is ready to drive. When yellow, Husky is receiving commands, but will not drive due to emergency stop or another error. When red, serial communications are currently timed-out. |
| <img src="/img/robot_husky_5.png" width="50"/> | **General Error Status** Illuminates red when Husky will not drive due to an error state. Such states include emergency stop, insufficient battery power, or an unspecified software error.                                                                                                   |
| <img src="/img/robot_husky_6.png" width="50"/> | **Emergency Stop Status** Illuminates red when Husky will not drive due to the emergency stop being activated, either onboard or wireless (if available).                                                                                                                                     |
| <img src="/img/robot_husky_7.png" width="50"/> | **Charge Indicator** Illuminates red when Husky user power is being supplied externally.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Orientation references

The reference frame used by all Clearpath Robotics ground vehicles is based on ISO 8855, and is shown in the figure below.
Husky's front is shown.
When commanded with a positive translational velocity (forward), wheels travel in the positive x-direction.
The direction of the axes differs from those used for roll, pitch, and yaw in aircraft, and care should be taken to ensure that data is interpreted correctly.

### Pinout

Husky provides a female DE-9 connector for communication with a host device.
The pinout of this connector is shown below.

The connectors used in the Husky's user bay  are Weidmüller's 6 Position Terminal Blocks, to connect your own bare wires, you may use Digi-key part number 281-1856-ND.
